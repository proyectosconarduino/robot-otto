# Summary

Who is Otto?
===============
An interactive robot that anyone can make!
Otto walks, dances, makes sounds and avoids obstacles 
<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AOQpcEnxrAU?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" style="position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
Is completely open source, Arduino compatible and 3D printable

Otto was inspired by another robot BoB the BiPed and programmed using code from another open source biped robot Zowi.
CC-BY-SA

Otto's differences are in the assembled size (11cm x 7cm x12cm), cleaner integration of components and expressions. Using off the shelf and 3D printed parts, simple electronics connections (almost no welding required), and basic coding skills, you will be able to build your own cute Otto friend in as little as two hours!

Otto is designed using Autodesk 123D Design software (now thinkercad) you can modify it for customization or further improvements!

Gather all the off the shelf parts that you'll need for this assembly.

List of parts:
===============
1. Arduino Nano;
2. Arduino Nano Shield I/O Extension Board Expansion XD-212
3. Mini usb cable.
4. HC-SR04 Ultrasound sensor.
5. Mini servo SG90 9g x4 (each one should come with 2 pointed screws and one small screw also arm keys to attach legs and feet).
6. 5V Buzzer.
7. Female to Female breadboard connectors cable 10cm x6.
8. 4 AA Battery case
9. 1.5V AA batteries x4.
10. Mini cross screwdriver. (important magnetized)

And then you only need to 3D print 6 parts in total:
11. 3D printed head.
12. 3D printed body.
13. 3D printed leg x2.
14. 3D printed right foot.
15. 3D printed left foot.

Added space for a 8x8mm switch and the buzzer
update feet and legs version 04, now no need high precision printer to have good assembly with motors just use the small plastic arm that comes with the servo motor SG90 to attach them.

Use Instruction Manual for assembly instructions and Arduino coding. Or follow this step by step https://www.hackster.io/cparrapa/otto-build-your-own-robot-in-one-hour-5f2a1c that shows how to build Otto DIY from scratch.

For the programming start:
==================
1. Download & Install Arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/

2. Copy all libraries in OTTO_DIY_all.zip to C:\Users\user\Documents\Arduino\libraries (or wherever your library folder is installed): 

3. Finally open OTTO_smooth_criminal.ino code & upload to your Arduino Nano for dancing Otto mode.

4. Try OTTO_avoid.ino for obstacle avoidance

# Print Settings

Printer: FlashForge Finder
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.15mm
Infill: 20%

Notes: 
Recommended to use a FDM 3D printer with PLA material.

You can print individually piece by piece to match the colors of the original design or optionally print all at the same time in an area of 14cm x 14cm.

# Post-Printing

## Legs and Foot fitting

For almost all 3d printers is recommendable use the new version 04 .stl files to print, then you just use the plastic arm of the servo motors with some glue to assemble them together.

# How I Designed This

## Designed using 123D Design (now thinkercad!)
